## Theory
- The aim of a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator is to provide a simple numerical value that helps individuals assess whether they have a healthy body weight relative to their height. BMI is a commonly used measure to categorize individuals into different weight status categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.


### The formula for BMI is:  BMI=weight(kg)/height(m^2)
â€‹
 ### The aim of using BMI as a tool is to:
 - Monitor Weight Changes: Individuals can use BMI to monitor changes in their weight over time. By tracking their BMI, they can assess whether their weight management efforts are leading to improvements or if they need to make adjustments to their lifestyle.

- Guide Treatment Plans: BMI calculations can inform healthcare professionals in developing personalized treatment plans for individuals who are underweight, overweight, or obese. These plans may include dietary recommendations, exercise regimens, or medical interventions.

- Promote Healthy Lifestyles: BMI calculators can raise awareness about the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and encourage individuals to adopt healthier lifestyle behaviors, such as eating a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity.

#### While BMI is a useful tool for assessing weight status at the population level, it has limitations and may not be accurate for everyone, especially those with high muscle mass or certain medical conditions. Therefore, BMI should be used in conjunction with other measures and assessments to evaluate overall health status accurately.

## Results
#### The concept of local storage in javascript is used to store the latest values entered by the user which are then displayed on the browser when the user reexecutes the code.
